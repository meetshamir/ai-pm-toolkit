# AI PM Toolkit

> A collection of AI prompts and agents for Product Managers — from content creation to vibe coding.

## 🎯 What's This?

I'm a PM who went from AI skeptic to AI-native builder. Along the way, I've created prompts and agents that help me work faster and think better.

This repo is my attempt to share what's actually working.

## 📁 Structure

```

├── prompts/
│   ├── content/       # Content creation (newsletters, posts, carousels)
│   ├── product/       # PM work (PRDs, specs, user stories)

├── agents/            # Reusable AI agents for complex workflows
└── examples/          # Example outputs
```

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Using a Prompt
1. Find a prompt that fits your need
2. Copy the prompt into ChatGPT, Copilot, or your AI tool of choice
3. Customize the context sections for your situation
4. Iterate!

### Using an Agent
Agents are designed for multi-step workflows. They work best in:
- VS Code with GitHub Copilot
- ChatGPT with persistent context
- Any AI tool that supports longer conversations

## 📚 What's Included

### Agents
| Agent | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| [Content Refinement Agent](agents/content-refinement-agent.md) | Iteratively refine articles, posts, and carousels paragraph by paragraph |

### Prompts
| Category | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| [Content](prompts/content/) | LinkedIn posts, newsletter articles, carousels |
| [Product](prompts/product/) | PRDs, specs, user research synthesis |
| [Coding](prompts/coding/) | Vibe coding, prototyping, debugging |

## 💡 Philosophy

1. **Prompts should be reusable** — Generic enough to adapt, specific enough to be useful
2. **Context matters** — The best prompts include your voice, your situation, your constraints
3. **Iterate, don't generate** — AI is a thinking partner, not a content factory
4. **Share what works** — The AI PM community grows when we share our learnings
